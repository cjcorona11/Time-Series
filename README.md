In this project, we want to predict the hourly water flow of the Gallatin River in Bozeman, MT. This data set was scraped from publicly accessible USGS and SNOTEL websites where I gathered ten years worth of hourly weather and river flow data. I started by cleaning the data set including imputation of missing values. Then I performed an exploratory data analysis to determine what relationships exist among the predictors and the response. I looked at several time series visualizations to get a sense of how to best model this temporal correlation. I consider a Holt-Winters model and compare it to several ARIMA models with various sets of covariates. I evaluate the models with 5-fold cross-validation and give the results along with visualizations of predictions on the test set. All R code is attached in the appendix and the data set is included in this repository.
