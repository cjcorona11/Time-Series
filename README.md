In this project, we want to predict average monthly waterflow on the Gallatin River in Bozeman, MT. This data set was scraped from publicly accessible USGS and SNOTEL websites where I gathered ten years worth of hourly weather and river flow data. I started by cleaning the data set which involved lots of imputation. Next I aggregated the hourly data into monthly averages. With this aggregated data, I performed an exploratory data analysis to determine what relationships exist among the predictors and the response. I looked at several time series visualizations to get a sense of how to best model this temporal correlation. I consider a Holt-Winters model and compare it to several ARIMA models with various sets of covariates. I evaluate the models with 5-fold cross-validation and give the results along with visualizations of predictions on the test set. I include an extra step of building two Bayesian models based on my best performing models above. I evaluate the Bayesian models using ignorance scores as the loss function and check Bayesian diagnostics. All R code is attached in the appendix and the data set is included in this repository.
